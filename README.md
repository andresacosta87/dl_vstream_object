Deep Learning Video Detection using Tensor Flow on Jupyter Notebook

Create a new enviroment with anaconda and install all the libraries into it. 

I prefer use tensorflow 1.19 but you can use 2.0 version only if you do the change for Compatibility. 

Make sure that protobuf.exe compile into the model/research/object_detection folder 

Add the path folder as both sys.path and PATH_LABEL correctly, otherwise the model won't be loaded. 


Enjoy!!
